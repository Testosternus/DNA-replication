# DNA Replication
DNA is the building block of every organism. It contains genetic information that define almost every aspect of your very self. This application takes a series of bases and returns the complementary bases on the other side of the DNA helix.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo to your computer [link](https://github.com/Testosternus/DNA-replication.git)
