# DNA Replication
DNA is the building block of every organism. It contains genetic information that define almost every aspect of your very self. This application takes a series of bases and returns the complementary bases on the other side of the DNA helix.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo to your computer:  [link](https://github.com/Testosternus/DNA-replication.git)

### Prerequisites
* Any IDE that's able to run a .NET Framework Application
* [.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime)

## Running the tests
Enter a series of characters to see the complementary bases.
### Test example
```
in: "AAATACGGT"
out: "TTTATGCCA"
```
Invalid inputs get filtered out:
```
in: "h, o p"
out: ">> <input not valid>"
```
